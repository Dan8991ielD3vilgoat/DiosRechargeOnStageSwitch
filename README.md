#DiosRechargeOnStageSwitch
  
   When you DIE with the Item "Dio's Best Friend" you will be revived and receive the junk item
   "ExtraLifeConsumed" which just takes up space in your Inventory and
   has no functionality.
  
  
   But with this Mod the Item "ExtraLifeConsumed" will turn back into "Dio's Best Friend"
   every time you spawn in a new stage.
   
   So basically it recharges itself by completing a stage.
